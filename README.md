# CSE 3318: Algorithms and Data Structures Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio for **CSE 3318: Algorithms and Data Structures**. This repository contains my projects and assignments, showcasing my proficiency in implementing complex data structures and algorithms in C programming.

## Project Highlights

### Lab 1: Counter Manipulation and Maintenance
- Implemented a C program to maintain and manipulate a set of counters, demonstrating efficient data manipulation, searching, and dynamic memory management in C.

### Lab 2: Merging and Counting Strings from Multiple Files
- Developed a C program to merge strings from multiple files and count their occurrences, employing a heap data structure for efficient data processing.

### Lab 3: Dynamic Programming for Subset Sum Problem
- Crafted an algorithm in C to find two separate subsequences within a sequence, each summing to specified target values, using dynamic programming and memoization.

### Lab 4: Unbalanced Binary Search Tree
- Maintained an unbalanced binary search tree in C to process various commands like insertion, logical deletion, and finding ranks, highlighting tree properties and operations.

### Lab 5: Minimum Spanning Forest for a Weighted Graph
- Computed a minimum spanning forest for a weighted, undirected graph, implementing hash tables, union-find algorithm, and sorting edges by weight.
